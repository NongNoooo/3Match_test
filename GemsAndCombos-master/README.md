# Gems And Combos

This is a replica of the puzzle mechanic in PAD. It was created in Unity using C# by myself, Mr.Muffles.


## Remaining Issues

In PAD, once all matches have been calculated, each matched block will disappear in a sequenced event. The delay between each matched block isn't working correctly in this project. I didn't spend any time on it as it is a purely cosmetic feature and all the core functionality (most likely) works.

Also, if you wish to scale the board to any size in the future, you'll have to go through the code replacing all the 6's and 5's in the code with a variable.

Lastly, I tested the game quite a lot, as shown in the Youtube video, but I didn't test it much once I completed the project. There still may be fringe case issues like odd shapes not matching or clicking too fast somwhere/somehow breaks it.

## Enjoy
